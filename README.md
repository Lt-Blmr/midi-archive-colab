# MIDI Archive Colab

This repo helps you organize, sort, and clean your MIDI files for use in AI training and creative production workflows. Whether youâ€™re triaging thousands of .mid files or building curated datasets, this system gives you a sieve-like process to sort by quality, genre, and metadata tags.

## Features
- MIDI parsing, validation, and error filtering
- Multi-tiered quality sorting (like soil sifting)
- Genre/metadata enrichment using APIs
- JSON export for downstream machine learning

## How to Use
1. Upload MIDI files to `data/input_midi`
2. Run one of the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder
3. Sorted output is written to `data/sorted_output`

Coming soon: Genre classifiers and MIDI visualizers!
